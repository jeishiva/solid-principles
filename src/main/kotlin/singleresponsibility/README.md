## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) â€” Game Settings Management

### ðŸ“– Story

In a game application, we handle:
- **Fetching feature flags** (e.g., multiplayer enabled?)
- **Fetching player game state** (e.g., level, score)
- **Caching game state**

Initially, all responsibilities were handled by one class.

### ðŸš« Problem

When a class handles **multiple unrelated responsibilities**, like:
- Downloading feature flags
- Fetching game state
- Caching data

...you violate the **Single Responsibility Principle**.

> One class should have **only one reason to change**.

### âœ… Solution

We refactor the logic into focused components:
- `GameFeatureFlagFetcher` â€” fetches feature flags only
- `GameStateFetcher` â€” fetches game state only
- `GameStateCache` â€” handles caching only

This improves:
- **Maintainability** â†’ Each class is easier to modify and understand
- **Extensibility** â†’ You can add cloud sync or disk caching without touching unrelated code
- **Testability** â†’ Each class can be unit tested in isolation
