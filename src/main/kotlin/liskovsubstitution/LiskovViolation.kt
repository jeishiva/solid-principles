/**
 * This design violates the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP).
 *
 * LiveStream inherits from VideoPlayer but overrides the `rewind()` method
 * to throw an exception â€” breaking the expected behavior of clients using VideoPlayer.
 *
 * This means LiveStream cannot safely be substituted where a VideoPlayer is expected,
 * causing runtime errors or defensive programming in client code.
