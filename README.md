## 🎯 SOLID Principles — Real-World Stories in Kotlin

This project delivers the five **SOLID principles** in the most memorable and developer-friendly way —  
using relatable **real-world use cases** from platforms like **YouTube**, **WhatsApp**, and **game apps**.

Each principle is backed by a mini-story to make it easy to grasp, apply, and never forget.

---

### 📚 What's Inside

- ✅ **Story-driven explanations**  
  Each principle begins with a short narrative — a practical situation you might actually encounter.

- 🚫 **Violation examples**  
  See what happens when the principle is ignored — tightly coupled, hard-to-test, rigid code.

- ✅ **Compliant refactor**  
  Clean, extensible code that applies the principle properly with clear separation of concerns.

- 🧠 **Readability-focused structure**  
  Short comments, consistent structure, and lightweight interfaces to focus on clarity and intent.

### 🧩 Principles Covered

| Principle | Folder | Story Theme |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **S** - Single Responsibility | `singleresponsibility/` | Game state and feature flags |
| **O** - Open/Closed           | `openclosed/`           | WhatsApp media message rendering |
| **L** - Liskov Substitution   | `liskovsubstitution/`   | YouTube video vs. livestream playback |
| **I** - Interface Segregation | `interfacesegregation/` | RTC SDK with optional capabilities |
| **D** - Dependency Inversion  | `dependencyinversion/`  | Health alerts from wearable devices |

Each folder includes:
- A detailed `README.md` with the story and insight
- `*.kt` files for **violation** and **compliant** implementations

### 👨‍💻 Why This Project?

We wanted to go beyond dry textbook definitions.  
Instead of abstract rules, we turned each principle into a **memorable mental model** with stories you'll actually remember in interviews or production code.

---

### 🛠️ Requirements

- Kotlin (JVM)
- IDE like IntelliJ or Android Studio

---

Feel free to explore, refactor, and extend the examples —  
the goal is not just to **know** SOLID, but to **think** SOLID.
